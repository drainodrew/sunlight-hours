ideas: 

- create a conditonal that changes the intensity of background color based upon
how many hours of sunlight the city or country gets 

in cities and country need to have an alert for if you submit somethign that isn't a found country or city 



okay decide what you are going to do .


the concept is to have an input form. 
when you put the name of a city in the form, it displays the data of that city. 

so, currently, i have an api call that pulls in all the objects... ie all the cities. 392 of them. 

so far i have been trying to do a map. what i will actually need to do is a search array method. 

so, i need it so that when you submit a city in the form, it filters through the array and then displays that that city. 

   { {cityLight.map((city, index) => (
        <p key={index}>{city}</p>
      )
     )} 



     {filtering.map((city, index) => (
        <body
          key={index}
          style={{
            backgroundColor: city.Year < 2534 ? '#ff9c59'
              : city.Year < 3062 ? '#e25822'
                : city.Year < 5000 ? 'red'
                  : "initial"
          }}/> ))}       
      

              style={{
              backgroundColor: city.Year < 2534 ? '#ff9c59'
              : city.Year < 3062 ? '#e25822'
                : city.Year < 5000 ? 'red'
                  : "black"
            }}
