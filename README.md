## React 
This project was built with react. 

## Functionality 
The "cities" tab is 90% of the project. It provides an input field where users can type a city name. If they city is in the database, it will display the total amount of sunlight it receives in a year. 

## Future 
I would like to add dynamic styling, so that the background color changes in relation to the percentile the cities is in (e.g. if a city is in the 90th percentile, the background will turn red). 

I would also like to implement better error messages. For example, if someone types a city that is not in the database, it should let the user know.
